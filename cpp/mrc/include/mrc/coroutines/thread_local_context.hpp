/**
 * @brief The SRF Runtime has several third-party dependencies that make use of thread_local storage. Because
 * coroutines can yield execution, other coroutines running on the same thread might modify the thread local storage
 * which would have non-deterministic consequences for the resuming coroutine. Since coroutines can also migrate to
 * other threads, it's important for the awaiter to capture any thread local state so it can be restored regardless of
 * where the coroutine is resumed.
 *
 * This could be used to capture thread local state from libraries like CUDA or OpenTelemetry; however, at present time
 * the cost to capture and restore thread local state far exceeds the benefits.
 *
 * This object will be used as a base for Awaiters in the hope that someday more thread local state can move as a
 * context with a coroutine. In the meantime, ThreadLocalContext does capture one meaning thread local value, i.e. a
 * pointer to the coroutines::ThreadPool that was executing the coroutine upto the point it was suspended. Capturing
 * this information allows us to extend concept::awaiter objects to become concept::resumable objects where the
 * programmer can provide guidance on how and where a coroutine should be resumed.
