 * @brief SystemProvider is a base class designed provide access to the System object.
 *
 * This is on of the most common base classes in the internal library. It was found that many classes needed some
 * information from System, either the Options or the Partition information and commonly both. This base class avoids
 * the repeatitive of taking ownership of a shared_ptr<System> and providing const access to that object.
 *
 * Classes like HostPartitionProvider and PartitionProvider extend SystemProvider by adding other common information
 * needing to be propagated.
