# Morpheus Runtime Core (MRC)

The **Morpheus Runtime Core** (MRC) library is a **reactive, network-aware, flexible, and performance-oriented streaming data library** that standardizes building modular and reusable pipelines with both C++ and Python. Designed to efficiently handle non-deterministic volumes and highly variable data streams, MRC is the backbone for NVIDIA's [Morpheus](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/Morpheus) cyber security library. It's goal is to serve as a common high-performance streaming data layer in which all personas of developers, ranging from Data Scientists to DevOps and Performance Engineers, find value.

### Major features and differentiators
 - Built in C++ for performance, with Python bindings for ease of use and rapid prototyping, with options for maximizing performance
 - Distributed computation with message transfers over RDMA using UCX
 - Dynamic reconfiguration to scale up and out at runtimeâ€‹; requires no changes to pipeline configuration
 - Unopinionated data model: messages of any type can be used in the pipeline
 - Built from the ground up with asynchronous computation for mitigation of I/O and GPU blocking
 - Automatically handles backpressure (when the sender is operating faster than the receiver can keep up) and reschedules computation as needed

## Installation
MRC includes both Python and C++ bindings and supports installation via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), Docker, or from source.

### Prerequisites

- Pascal architecture (Compute capability 6.0) or better
- NVIDIA driver `450.80.02` or higher
- [conda or miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)
- If using Docker:
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - [The NVIDIA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)

### Conda Installation
Installing via Conda is the easiest method for getting the MRC components and supports both the Python and C++ bindings. To install the MRC conda package and build the C++ and hybrid components, follow the steps below. Please note, Conda performance can be greatly increased via [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba). To install Mamba in an existing Conda environment, simply run:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
```

If you choose to use Mamba rather than Conda, simply replace `conda` with `mamba` in the instructions below.

#### Python Bindings
```bash
# If needed, create a new conda environment
conda create --name mrc python=3.10

# Activate the newly created conda environment
conda activate mrc

# Install MRC Python bindings
conda install -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c conda-forge mrc
```

#### C++ Bindings
```bash
# If needed, create a new conda environment
conda create --name mrc python=3.10

# Activate the newly created conda environment
conda activate mrc

# Install MRC Python bindings
conda install -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c conda-forge libmrc
```

#### Full MRC Library
```bash
# If needed, create a new conda environment
conda create --name mrc python=3.10

# Activate the newly created conda environment
conda activate mrc

# Install MRC Python bindings
conda install -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c conda-forge mrc libmrc
```

#### Optional Settings
To avoid specifying the channels in the Conda commands above:
```bash
conda config --env --add channels conda-forge &&\
conda config --env --add channels nvidia &&\
conda config --env --add channels rapidsai
```

And to opt-in to nightly releases:
```bash
conda config --env --add channels nvidia/label/dev &&
conda config --env --add channels rapidsai-nightly
```

### Source Installation
Installing via source is for more advanced users and is necessary to try MRC features before an official release.

### Docker Installation
A Dockerfile is provided at `$MRC_ROOT` and can be built with
```bash
docker build -t mrc:latest .
```
To run the container
```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -it mrc:latest /bin/bash
```

## Quickstart Guide

To quickly learn about both the C++ and Python MRC APIs, including following along with various complexity examples, we recommend following the MRC Quickstart Repository located [here](/docs/quickstart/README.md). This tutorial walks new users through topics like
- Creating a simple MRC pipeline
- Using a custom datatype between MRC nodes
- Using Reactive-style operators inside nodes for complex functionality
- Understand how threads and buffers can effect performance
- Mixing C++ and Python, for example - defining compute nodes in C++ and calling them from Python
