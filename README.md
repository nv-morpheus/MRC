### !!! Work In Progress !!!

While were close to our public release, we still have a few things to finalize before the repository is ready for public use. Check back in a few days for more details.

# Streaming Reactive Framework (SRF)

The Streaming Reactive Framework (SRF) library (pronounced "surf") is designed to build high throughput, low latency pipelines.

Major features include:
 - Built in C++ for performance, with Python bindings for ease of use
 - Code-first pipeline design
 - Distributed computation with message transfers over RMDA using UCX
 - Dynamic reconfiguration to scale up and out at runtimeâ€‹. Requires no changes to pipeline configuration
 - Unopinionated data model. Messages of any type can be used in the pipeline
 - Built from the ground up with asynchronous computation for mitigation of I/O and GPU blocking
 - Automatically handles backpressure and reschedules computation as needed
 - Focused on rapid pipeline development, with options for maximizing performance

## Quickstart
