The `Dockerfile` in this directory defines the images used by the CI runner not for MRC itself.

# Building CI images
The `Dockerfile` defines two targets: `base` and `driver`. The `driver` target includes the Nvidia driver needed to build MRC on a machine without access to a GPU.

To build the images from the root of the MRC repo run:
```bash
SKIP_PUSH=1 ci/runner/build_and_push.sh
```

# Build and push CI images
This will require being a member of the `Morpheus Early Access CI` group in [NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com) and logging into the `nvcr.io` registry prior to running.

From the root of the MRC repo run:
```bash
ci/runner/build_and_push.sh
```

If the images are already built, the build step can be skipped by setting `SKIP_BUILD=1`.

# Updating CI to use the new images
Update `.github/workflows/pull_request.yml` changing these two lines with the new image names:
```yaml
      container: nvcr.io/ea-nvidia-morpheus/morpheus:mrc-ci-driver-221128
      test_container: nvcr.io/ea-nvidia-morpheus/morpheus:mrc-ci-base-221128
```
